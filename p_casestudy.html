            <p class="caseCopy">I planned and conducted six 1-on-1 interviews for potential users to find out how they felt about the tools they used to make their travel plans.

            <p class="caseCopy">From the interviews conducted, I created an affinity diagram to organize my research.

She needs to read all of the reviews when she plans trips with her friends to help make the best decision and stay in budget. She loves when she can afford to stay at a super cute location so she can post pictures  to her Instagram feed.

        <div class="sectionText">
            <h4>User Insight</h4>
            <p class="caseCopy">A budget conscious traveler needs access to comprehensive reviews when preparing their itinerary because they want to confirm they are selecting the best experiences available when visiting a new location.</p>
            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
            <p class="caseCopy">We have observed that current reviews lack reliable information for budget conscious travelers who are looking for new experiences to enjoy at their destination. Since their budget limits the experiences they can participate in, they want peace of mind knowing they made a good choice.</p>

            <p class="caseCopy">Having the features available for users to research and create itineraries is beneficial. Keeping it simple and not overcomplicating it for the user is the ideal situation. I learned a lot about how users flow through the app. I feel like this is something that could take a lot longer to do with all of the information and testing that is involved to make it a great product.</p>
            <h4>Next Steps</h4>
            <p class="caseCopy">Continue to iterate on prototype. There are lots of things that can be done to make it much better than it currently stands.</p>
